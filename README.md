Project Title: Opinion and Adjective Extraction for Topics

Project Description: 

This project aims to develop a Python-based application that performs web scraping on user-provided topics or names and analyses the extracted text data to identify adjectives and opinions related to the subject. The application will help users understand public sentiment, brand reputation, or general perception of a topic.


Key Objectives:

Scrape relevant content from various online sources (e.g., news websites, blogs, social media) based on user-provided topics or names.
Preprocess and clean the scraped data, removing irrelevant information, HTML tags, special characters, and URLs.
Apply Natural Language Processing techniques, such as Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, to filter out adjectives from the text.
Implement sentiment analysis and opinion mining to extract opinions related to the given topic or name.
Aggregate and visualise the extracted adjectives and opinions to present an understandable summary of the sentiment related to the topic or name.

Core Steps:

Set up the project environment and install the necessary libraries (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Requests, spaCy, NLTK).
Develop a web scraping module to fetch relevant content based on the user-provided topic or name.
Create a text preprocessing module to clean and tokenize the scraped data.
Implement a POS tagging module to identify and extract adjectives from the text.
Develop a sentiment analysis and opinion mining module to extract opinions from the text.
Aggregate and visualise the extracted adjectives and opinions using appropriate visualisations (e.g., word clouds, bar charts, pie charts).
Test and refine the application using various topics and names to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness.
