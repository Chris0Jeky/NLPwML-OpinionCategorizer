Project Title: Opinion and Adjective Extraction for Topics

Project Description: 

This project aims to develop a Python-based application that performs web scraping on user-provided topics or names and analyses the extracted text data to identify adjectives and opinions related to the subject. The application will help users understand public sentiment, brand reputation, or general perception of a topic.


Key Objectives:

Scrape relevant content from various online sources (e.g., news websites, blogs, social media) based on user-provided topics or names.
Preprocess and clean the scraped data, removing irrelevant information, HTML tags, special characters, and URLs.
Apply Natural Language Processing techniques, such as Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, to filter out adjectives from the text.
Implement sentiment analysis and opinion mining to extract opinions related to the given topic or name.
Aggregate and visualise the extracted adjectives and opinions to present an understandable summary of the sentiment related to the topic or name.

Core Steps:

Set up the project environment and install the necessary libraries (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Requests, spaCy, NLTK).
Develop a web scraping module to fetch relevant content based on the user-provided topic or name.
Create a text preprocessing module to clean and tokenize the scraped data.
Implement a POS tagging module to identify and extract adjectives from the text.
Develop a sentiment analysis and opinion mining module to extract opinions from the text.
Aggregate and visualise the extracted adjectives and opinions using appropriate visualisations (e.g., word clouds, bar charts, pie charts).
Test and refine the application using various topics and names to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness.

NEXT Steps:


Web scraping enhancements:

Implement a more robust web scraping mechanism that can handle different websites and sources (e.g., news websites, blogs, social media).
Add support for pagination and dynamic loading of content in websites.
Consider using APIs for platforms like Twitter, Reddit, or Google News, where available, to improve data collection.
Text preprocessing improvements:


Add more text cleaning steps, such as removing HTML tags, special characters, URLs, and shortening excessively long words.
Implement an option to exclude specific words or phrases from analysis, based on user input.
Add support for other languages besides English by extending the list of stopwords and using appropriate language models.
Sentiment analysis and opinion mining:

Evaluate different sentiment analysis libraries or tools, like TextBlob or VADER, to improve the accuracy of the sentiment scores.
Implement aspect-based sentiment analysis to identify specific aspects within the text and their associated sentiment.

Visualisation enhancements:

Provide more visualisation options like bar charts, pie charts, or bubble charts to better represent the sentiment distribution.
Customise the visualisations further by allowing users to select colours, fonts, and other design elements.

User interaction:

Implement a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI) to allow users to easily input the topics or names, choose the sources to scrape, and customise the visualisations.
Save the visualisations as image files or export them as reports in different formats (e.g., PDF, CSV).

Performance and scalability:

Optimise your code for better performance by using more efficient algorithms or parallel processing techniques.
Consider using cloud-based services or distributed computing for large-scale data collection and analysis.

Documentation and code quality:

Write detailed comments and documentation for your code to make it more understandable and maintainable.
Follow best practices for code style, organisation, and error handling.
Continuously refine and expand your test suite to cover more edge cases and ensure the robustness of your application.
